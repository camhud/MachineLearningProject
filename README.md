# Project File Descriptions

## Main Files
### Note_Recognition .ipynb

Convolutional Neural Network code and final results. Generates and exports `nsynth_cnn_model.h5`.

### nsynth_cnn_model.h5

Pre-trained model used in `demo.ipynb`.

### demo.ipynb

This is a demonstration of our fitted convolutional neural network using audio not from our training/validation/testing dataset.

## Other Files

### old project results.ipynb

Contains the results from training an SVM and CNN on MFCC features.

### Keras Note Recognition .ipynb

Contains more experimentation of training CNNs with MFCC features.
